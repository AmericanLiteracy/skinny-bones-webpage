For more than 150 years the American Literacy Council (ALC) has issued scholarly research, publications and innovative strategies, to help counter the dismal literacy statistics found in most English-speaking countries. Our goal is to share with you tools, concepts, and action plans that support this effort.

We have collected and posted, on this site, a variety of related materials: scholarly articles, practical "how-to" case studies, recordings, videos, conceptual debates, sources for software packages, links to classroom materials, lists of funding sources, professional organizations, statistical studies, and examples of innovative initiatives.

I can be reached at the Boulder Colorado Literacy Research Center by calling (303) 440-7385 or emailing Ramole@aol.com.

Warm Regards,

Robert Alan Mole, President
American Literacy Council



The American Literacy Council's main purpose is to convey information on new solutions, innovative technologies, and tools for engaging more boldly in the battle for literacy.
