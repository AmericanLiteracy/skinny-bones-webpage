For more than 150 years the American Literacy Council (ALC) has issued scholarly research, publications and innovative strategies, to help counter the dismal literacy statistics found in most English-speaking countries. Our goal is to share with you tools, concepts, and action plans that support this effort.

We have collected and posted, on this site, a variety of related materials: scholarly articles, practical "how-to" case studies, recordings, videos, conceptual debates, sources for software packages, links to classroom materials, lists of funding sources, professional organizations, statistical studies, and examples of innovative initiatives.

I can be reached at the Boulder Colorado Literacy Research Center by calling (303) 440-7385 or emailing Ramole@aol.com.

Warm Regards,

Robert Alan Mole, President
American Literacy Council
