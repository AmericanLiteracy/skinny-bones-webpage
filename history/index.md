A History of Literacy Initiatives in the United States and the Role of the American Literacy Council:
The number of people who can not read continues to go up, largely because of the flow of millions of Spanish-speaking people who flow across the southern borders from Mexico. Those few who apply for citizenship generally learn to speak and read English as a requirement of that process. But, with over 2.5 million people who not only can't read English, but who also cannot speak the language, the illiteracy rate increases every day.

Thoughtful writers have identified five causes of illiteracy. Scholars write books describing two or more of these causes as being the problem that needs to be attacked.

The original article states that the English language with its highly erratic system of spelling and the social factors are the main causes of the literacy dilemma of the US. If time permits the reader is encourage to read the entirety of the History of Literacy Initiatives in the U.S.
