The American Literacy Council's main purpose is to convey information on new solutions, innovative technologies, and tools for engaging more boldly in the battle for literacy.

For more than 150 years the American Literacy Council (ALC) has issued scholarly research, publications and innovative strategies, to help counter the dismal literacy statistics found in most English-speaking countries. Our goal is to share with you tools, concepts, and action plans that support this effort.

We have collected and posted, on this site, a variety of related materials: scholarly articles, practical "how-to" case studies, recordings, videos, conceptual debates, sources for software packages, links to classroom materials, lists of funding sources, professional organizations, statistical studies, and examples of innovative initiatives.

Our present efforts include: exposure to SoundSpel, DoublLien, Ed Lias' Word List, Writing Program, and the development of a DVD program Learning to Read.

History of The American Literacy Council
The American Literacy Council is the name of the non-profit organization organized by scholars in 1876 to provide rural educators with literacy tools and methods appropriate for schools at that time. Their focus included considerable linguistic research related to the study of illogical spelling standards that underlie standard English spelling. Major names and organizations supported their efforts including Andrew Carnegie, Melvin Dewey, many book authors, and newspaper editors of that time period. The organization continued, evolving to be renamed "The American Literacy Council."

Department of Education statistics indicate that, in the United States, approximately one person in five cannot read English adequately, measured by national surveys at the county level, counting people with an inability to read want ads, fill out job application forms, read maps, or read story books to children.
